# AMS
Asset Management System for CSCE 361 and Region V Systems

# About
The Asset Management System (AMS) was created as a class project by Matt Maas, Marta Kodin, Johnathan Avery and Andy Petrzilka. The AMS will be implemented by a local none profit called Region V Systems as a system to track all their assets. The AMS is written in PHP with multiple JavaScript libraries including DataTables, Bootstrap, Jquery, MorrisJS and more. The system allows users to add assets, delete assets, retire assets, edit assets, add users, edit users, delete users and run various reports.
